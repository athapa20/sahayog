            We are a compassionate non-profit organization dedicated to transforming the lives of animals across Nepal. Our mission began with a deep commitment to support the efforts of{" "}
            <a href="https://www.spcanepal.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>SPCA Nepal</a>, and we have since expanded our vision to uplift other like-minded animal welfare organizations throughout the country.
            We have also collaborated with <a href="https://www.saharaanimalcare.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Sahara Animal Care</a> to further advance our shared mission of improving animal welfare.
              <br /><br />
              From rescuing injured or abandoned animals on the streets to providing critical veterinary care, safe shelter, and long-term rehabilitation, we strive to give every animal a second chance at life. Our work also includes robust spay/neuter programs to control the stray population, educational outreach to promote kindness and responsible pet ownership, and adoption initiatives to place animals in loving homes.
              <br /><br />
              As a recognized 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organization, your generous donations are fully tax-deductible and directly fund these lifesaving programs. Whether you're here to volunteer, sponsor, adopt, or simply learn more, we invite you to explore our website and join us in building a more humane and compassionate Nepal for animals and the communities that care for them.
